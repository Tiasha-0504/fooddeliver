# 📦 Online Food Delivery Time Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a food delivery dataset to understand how various factors (such as weather, traffic, and time of day) influence the delivery duration. It also includes a regression model to predict delivery time based on key features.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

- Analyze factors affecting food delivery times.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values.
- Visualize relationships between delivery time and variables like weather, traffic, etc.
- Build and evaluate a prediction model for delivery duration.
- Plot and interpret actual vs predicted delivery time.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `Food_Delivery_Times.csv`, which includes the following sample columns:
- `Delivery_Time_min`: Target variable (in minutes)
- `Weather`: Weather conditions during delivery
- `Traffic_Level`: Traffic conditions
- `Time_of_Day`: Time slot for the delivery
- Other relevant operational features

## 🧪 Key Steps in the Notebook

1. **File Upload and Setup**
2. **EDA using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**
3. **Missing Data Handling**
4. **Correlation Analysis**
5. **Visualization of Delivery Time Distribution**
6. **Data Cleaning**
7. **Model Training** (e.g., Linear Regression or similar)
8. **Prediction and Evaluation**
9. **Actual vs Predicted Plot** – to visually evaluate model performance

## 📈 Final Visualization: Actual vs Predicted Delivery Times

- A scatter plot compares the predicted delivery times with actual times.
- A red diagonal line represents perfect prediction.
- The closer the points are to this line, the better the model performance.
